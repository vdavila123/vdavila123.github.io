                                            <p> The product: Florista florist is a florist shop located in the capital of Peru. Florista Florist strives to deliver beautiful flowers and offers the choice to build a flower arrangement for which one can select the kind and amount of flowers one wants and modify the price. Florista Florist's target customers are workers who lack the time to send a flower arrangement and are looking to send something more personalized.</p>

                                            <p> Project duration: October 2021- February 2022 </p>
                                            <p> The problem: The lack of time that busy workers have to shop for flower arrangements and their need to personalize them.</p>

                                            <p> The goal: Design an app for Florista Florist that allows users to deliver flower arrangements and personalize them.</p>

                                            <p> My role: UI/UX designer designing an app for Florista Florist from conception to delivery. </p>


                                            <p> Responsibilities: Conducting interviews, paper, and digital wireframes, low and high fidelity prototyping, conducting usability studies, accounting for accessibility, and iterating on designs.</p>

                                          </div>


                                                      <div  <h1 class="description m-t-40">Design Framework </h1>
                                                      <p> Among all the design frameworks taught to us in the Google Certification, I chose a Lean UX approach to my project. With this design framework, I started with the first step which was 'Think'. In this step, I started gathering research, so  that I could have a clear idea of who the product was for and how it would help the users. Then, I continued with the second step, which was 'Make'. In this step, I started designing the product and changing the design based on the feedback users gave me. For the last step 'Check', I started testing my design with users and adjusting all of the details that weren’t understood in the design. </p>

                                                    <div  <h1 class="description m-t-40">Understanding the user</h1>

                                                      <p>I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the users I´m designing for and their needs. A primary user group identified through research were young working people, between the ages of 20-30, who buy flowers for different events such as funerals, mother’s or father´s day, for their partners or friends.</p>
                                                      <p>  Before making the interviews I had the hypothesis that because there are a lot of florist shops, the UI on their websites or apps would be great, but after conducting the interviews I found out that my hypothesis was wrong. There were a lot of pain points in the UI design that didn't help the users realize their goals. Other user problems were about time, money, process, and support.</p>

                                                     <p> AI: Too many colors on it, lack of colors on it, lack of pictures, and very disorganized. </p>
                                                     <p> Process: The user could not find the purchase button to end their process.
The user could not find the category´s section to select a type of flower. </p>

                                                     <p> Support: The user could not visualize the stock of a product and select an estimated arrival time. Also, they couldn't find the store contact.</p>

                                                     <p> Time: Young working people don't have much time to go to a physical store to purchase flowers.</p>

                                                    <p>I interviewed some friends who normally buy flowers for different occasions. Then after interviewing them I chose two, who I think fits the target audience the best The first person that I interviewed was Paula. Her problem statement: Paula is a businesswoman who needs a way to send flowers to her friends because she is too busy working and doesn’t have the time to go to the shop to buy and deliver the flowers by herself. The second person was Nicolas. His problem statement: Nicolas is a developer who needs a way to select the kind and amount of flowers that he wants to send to his girlfriend so that the flowers won't be too expensive and he can send her flowers every month.</p>

                                                <p> Competitive analysis is one of the fundamental parts while doing the research, I analyze Peruvian competitors because that is where the app is going to be used. Here, I analyze 2 direct competitors (Rosatel and Greenhouse) and two indirect competitors (Floria Express and Big box). In this part, I analyze general information and the UX, such as first impressions, interactions, visual design, and content.</p>

                                                    <p>After the research part, I start thinking and creating a user flow about how the user is going to purchase the product.  A user flow allows me to see the complete app experience and helps me see all the screens that I’ll have to design for the app.</p>

                                              <p>To better understand how the user would use the product on a normal day, I created two types of storyboards. One is a Big picture storyboard to understand the whole process of the user using it, and the other one is a Close-up storyboard to better understand what is happening on the screens while the user is using it.</p>

                                                    <p>Taking the time to draft iterations of each screen of the app on paper ensured that the elements that made it to digital wireframes would be well-suited to address a user's pain points. For the “choose your kind and amount of flowers”, I prioritize a quick and easy way to choose the flowers easily. </p>

                                                    <p>As the initial design phase continued, I made sure to base screen designs on feedback and findings from user research. Here, I tried to create a solution for users that like to choose the type of flowers and the number of flowers they want, so that they can control the flower arrangement price. </p>

                                                      <p>As the navigation continued, I created this screen where the user can choose how the flower arrangement is going to be presented, so that they can also check the prices and choose one that fits their necessity/preference. </p>

                                              <p>Redesigning the app has been a challenging and rewarding journey. It was clear from the start that the major challenge was going to be making a better design that surfers would want to use and buy. I understood the needs of the users through the survey and conversations. I researched what the competitors offer in the market. Finally, I faced the challenge and created an app in which I could accomplish my goals by making the visual perspective and user experience better. I could also accomplish my goals by adding more information about each section and new features to the app.</p>
