                                          <p> Disclaimer: This case study was done to enhance my learning experience and challenge me to redesign it. I was not paid by Mis Olas to redesign their app.</p>
                                                      </div>

                                                      <div  <h1 class="description m-t-40">Introduction</h1>
                                                        <p>I started surfing around 7 years ago and since that first moment when I stepped for the first time on my surfboard, I fell in love with this sport. That’s why for my first UI/UX case study I wanted to redesign this App because I feel it is a concept that I know about and I think I have some ideas to implement, including changing the design, which would help it grow even more.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>About 6 months ago, my boyfriend found the application Mis Olas (My waves) and it changed the way we normally search for waves to surf. Before finding this app, we used to look at the forecast in other apps and trust them. Sometimes, the surf report wasn’t very precise, so we would drive for like an hour to a beach, only to find that the waves were too small or that the conditions were bad. Instead, we would have to drive back to our home or drive to nearby beaches to find a wave to surf.</p>
                                                        <p>Now, what we do firstly, is to check the cameras and then decide which beach we want to surf It saves us a lot of time, we no longer have to go all the way down to a beach and surprise ourselves with bad surfing conditions. Also, we can check how many people are surfing and decide if it is worth it to go at that moment.</p>
                                                    </div>

                                                    <div  <h1 class="description m-t-40">What is Mis Olas (My waves)?</h1>
                                                      <p>Mis Olas (My waves) is an App that shows, using real-time cameras, how the waves are in that exact moment. It was launched in 2021 for Peruvian surfers so they could find the best wave to surf that same day. Also, to save time in looking for a beach where the wave is in good condition. Right now, the app has 20 real-time cameras in 20 different waves found in the Peruvian coastal area. You can also check the forecast 10 days ahead, look at the events in 20 different places, use Multicam to check two spots at the same time, use a fast review to check the latest 10 minutes of the wave, and a reporting bot that is going to tell you how the waves are in real-time.
                                                      </p>
                                                   </div>
                                                   <div  <h1 class="description m-t-40">Why redesign?</h1>
                                                     <p>I love the concept of Mis Olas App, but I found it was lacking in the UI and UX behind it. I think the visual perspective could be improved a lot because a part from resolving a problem for surfers, the way it looks can also provide surfers with the confidence they need to buy the App. Also there are animations that confuse me, more than help and guide me, on where to go next. I also think there could be more options to implement, and some that should be removed, since they aren’t so necessary.
Now, I might not know the exact stats about how well the app is doing or how many users are using it, but I am sure that a redesign in which what I just mentioned could be implemented would help grow much bigger than what it is now. Hope you like it!</p>

                                                    <p>1. Improve customer experience on the app by improving the UI, UX and layout. That way the user will be able to understand perfectly how it works and will not get confused about using it also, make the customer want to buy the App.</p>
<p>2. Increase the information shown about the waves so, that every surfer has all the information they need, to know that they are going to catch the best available wave.</p>

                                              <p>What I found out from three of the most used apps to check the surf report, which are MagicSeaWeed, WindGuru, and Surfline. Also, from the local website SurfPlace Peru.</p>

                                              <p>Going further with the research, I identified 4 user personas that have different needs. This data will be useful to improve the user experience for each one of them.</p>
                                              <p>Personas: beginner surfer, the tourist surfer, the summer surfer, and the all-season surfer.</p>
                                              <p>I validate these user personas by interviewing 5 local surfers.</p>

                                              <p>I realize a storyboard to understand more what the actual user would do on a normal day to search for a wave to surf.</p>

                                              <p>After the market research, I started drawing the sketches to understand more about what the app should have on each screen, guiding myself with the sitemap. Also, the User flow allows me to see the complete experience of the App and helps me understand if the way I am drawing them was right or if I have to create other screens or add more things to it.</p>

                                              <p>These are the wireframes I did after the sketches. They allowed me to see the skeleton of the final app. After I finished doing all the wireframes, I tested them by asking a developer to check them and give me some feedback on what could be implemented and what could not be made real. He helped me a lot by giving me some advice on how to get the design better and this is how they ended up looking.</p>

                                              <p>Redesigning the app has been a challenging and rewarding journey. It was clear from the start that the major challenge was going to be making a better design that surfers would want to use and buy. I understood the needs of the users through the survey and conversations. I researched what the competitors offer in the market. Finally, I faced the challenge and created an app in which I could accomplish my goals by making the visual perspective and user experience better. I could also accomplish my goals by adding more information about each section and new features to the app.</p>
